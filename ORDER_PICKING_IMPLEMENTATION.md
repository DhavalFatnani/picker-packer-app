# Order Picking Implementation

## Overview
A new Order Picking screen has been added to the Picker-Packer mobile app, inspired by the reference design. This screen provides a dedicated interface for managing and picking customer orders.

## Components Created

### 1. OrderPickingScreen Component
**Location:** `mobile/src/components/OrderPickingScreen.tsx`

**Features:**
- Displays all orders assigned to the logged-in picker
- Order cards showing:
  - Order ID (ORD-XXXX)
  - Priority badge (Urgent, High, Normal, Low)
  - Due time (2 hours after assignment)
  - Customer name
  - Item count
  - Zones
  - Estimated pick time
  - View Details button (expandable)
  - Start Picking button
- Order count badge in the header
- Today's Performance metrics section
- Responsive layout with proper status bar handling

### 2. Backend Orders API
**Location:** `backend/src/routes/orders.ts`

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/orders` - Returns all orders assigned to the current user

**Data Returned:**
- Order details (number, status, priority, customer, warehouse)
- Order items (SKU, quantity, picked quantity, status)
- Auto-assignment information

### 3. Mobile API Integration
**Location:** `mobile/src/services/api.ts`

**New Function:**
```typescript
async getOrders(): Promise<any> {
  const response = await apiFetch('/api/orders');
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (!data.success) {
    throw new Error(data.error?.message || 'Failed to get orders');
  }
  
  return data.data || [];
}
```

## Database Schema

### Orders Table
- Stores customer order information
- Fields: `id`, `order_number`, `status`, `priority`, `assigned_to`, `warehouse`, `customer_name`, `total_items`, timestamps

### Order Items Table
- Stores individual items within each order
- Links to SKUs and bins
- Tracks picked quantity vs. required quantity

## UI/UX Flow

## Visual Design
